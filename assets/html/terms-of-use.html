This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at https://textblast.io ("Site") and the services, features, content, applications or widgets we offer (collectively "Service" or "Services" through the Site). By registering for or using the Site or Service in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site or Service, including users who are also contributors of content, information and other materials or services on the Site.</p>

<h3>You Accept These Terms Of Use</h3>

<p>The Site is offered subject to acceptance without modification of the Terms, which also incorporate our Privacy Policy and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Site, each of which we incorporate by reference and each of which we may update from time to time without notifying you. Services offered through the Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions that we issue from time to time, including but not limited to a separate end user license agreement; your use of such Services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which we incorporate into these Terms by this reference.</p>

We are not responsible for providing customer support, bug fixes, documentation, or any other support for the Site. We cannot guarantee availability of the Site to any user.</p>

<h3>Resolving Disputes</h3>

<p>A printed version of these Terms and any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based on or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

<p>The Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, and the United States of America. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in New York County, New York, under the Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual-property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators in accordance with AAA rules. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under these Terms shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert-witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection with the proceeding. Judgment on the award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the above, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.

<h3>Integration, Severability and Waiver</h3>

<p>These Terms (including those terms incorporated herein by reference) are the entire Agreement between you and us with respect to the Service and the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Service or Site. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary for the rest of this Agreement to remain enforceable. Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms. For any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding on us, one of our authorized representatives must provide you with written notice of that waiver.</p>

<h3>A Few More Details</h3>

<p>We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations here where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference). These Terms are personal to you and you may not assign, transfer or sub-license them except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations here without your consent. These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture or employment relationship and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. All notices under these Terms shall be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return-receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next-day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p>
