<h2 class="center">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="center md-caption">Last Updated: July 2015</p>

<p>We at Sesh, Inc ("Sesh," "we," "our," or "us") take your privacy seriously and know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared. By visiting or using the textblast.io website, applications, services or any other linked pages, features or content we offer from time to time in connection with our website or applications (collectively, the “Services”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you consent that we will collect, use and share your information in the following ways.</p>

<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to individuals whom we do not employ or manage. Nor does this policy apply to information you choose to disclose publicly on the Services (such as information that other Services users can see), which is not considered Personal Information.</p>

<h3>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>

<p>We do not permanently store any information that is collected, and we never store or have access to any credit card information. Your name and the recipient's phone number are recorded while a text blast is active and cleared once it's complete.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy Issues</h3>

<p>We do not intend to and do not want to collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Any use of the Services by children under the age of 13 should be conducted under the supervision of that child's parent or guardian. Information should not be submitted to the Service by anyone under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. If we learn that a user under 13 years of age has submitted personally identifiable information online, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law). We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

<h3>Third Party Services</h3>

<p>The Service may allow you to connect with certain third-party services (Twitter, Facebook and other similar services). When you broadcast information to these third-party services, that information is no longer under our control and is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>The Services may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions of use, or any of the content of such sites. The linked sites may collect personal information from you that is not subject to our control. The data collection practices of linked sites will be governed by that site's privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Is Personal Information About You Secure?</h3>

<p>Sesh and the vendors that provide hosting services for us use a variety of security technologies and administrative procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure with security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. For example, your personal information is stored on computer systems located in controlled facilities. Internal access to users' private and non-public personal information is restricted to site administrators and others on a need-to-know basis.</p>

<p>We endeavor to safeguard user information and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

<p>The Services may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Services. You can determine if any changes were made to this Privacy Policy by noting the date that it was last updated. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Services after such changes have been first posted.</p>

<h3>Questions And Concerns</h3>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message at support@textblast.io. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
